 = Why doesn't Blubrry PowerPress support multiple enclosures in one feed item/post? =
Blubrry PowerPress does not allow you to include multiple media files for one feed item (blog post). This is because each podcatcher handles multiple enclosures in feeds differently. iTunes will download the first enclosure that it sees in the feed ignoring the rest. Other podcatchers and podcasting directories either pick up the first enclosure or the last in each post item. This inconsistency combined with the fact that [Dave Winer does not recommend multiple enclosures](http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2004/12/21) and the [FeedValidator.org recommendation against it](http://www.feedvalidator.org/docs/warning/DuplicateEnclosure.html) is why the Blubrry PowerPress does not support them.

As a alternative, PowerPress allows you to create additional Custom Podcast Feeds to associate any magnitude of media format and/or length in a blog post to specific custom feeds. For example, you can create one blog post associated to separate video and audio podcast feeds saving you time from entering your show notes twice. 

 = Why doesn't Blubrry PowerPress include media statistics built-in? =
 Blubrry PowerPress does not include media statistics built-in. This is not because Blubrry has its own statistics service, although that's a good reason by itself. Maintaining and calculating statistics is a resource and server intensive task that would add bloat to an otherwise efficient WordPress podcasting plugin. We recommend using your media hosting's web statistics to give you basic download numbers and, if you are seeking more grandular measurements such as client and geographical information for each episode, you're more than welcome to use the [Blubrry Statistics service](http://create.blubrry.com/resources/podcast-media-download-statistics/) as well.
 
 You may however access your Blubrry Statistics from within your WordPress dashboard.
 
 = How do you insert the player within a blog post? =
You can insert the media player within your blog posts by using the WordPress shortcode feature. The shortcode for PowerPress is `[powerpress]` (all lowercase)

 You may use the shortcode to add a player to other media files (non episode files) by specifying the media url in the shortcode: [powerpress url="http://example.com/path/to/media.mp3"]
	
 For advanced users with multiple podcast feeds, you may insert the player for a specific feed by specifying the feed slug in the shortcode: [powerpress feed="podcast"]
 
 If you want to specify a cover image, add an image attribute which points to the specific image url: [powerpress image="http://example.com/path/to/cover_image.jpg"] *Experimental*
	
 = Why can't you upload large media files? =
 File uploads are tricky to handle because there are so many web hosting variations with different upload size limits. We recommend using an FTP application to upload large media files. FTP is much more efficient than web based uploads and is typically provided by nearly all web hosting providers.

  = The Media Player does not appear on my site? =
. . . or the RSS feed is invalid?

This can happen when there is a theme or plugin conflict. Please visit our [Diagnosing Feed and/or Player Issues](http://create.blubrry.com/resources/powerpress/using-powerpress/diagnosing-feed-andor-player-issues-with-powerpress/) for instructions how to resolve such issues.

* Happy Holidays! [Jeff Buckley cover of Everyday People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CHwqGCnh7E)


= 6.2.2 =
* Released on 12/9/2015
* WordPress 4.4 has changed how feed titles are set. Please update PowerPress immediately to avoid feed title issues.
* Feed titles in WP 4.4 no longer use the `get_bloginfo_rss` filter. All other feed fields appear to still be using the `get_bloginfo_rss` filter at this time. We will be taking additional measures in future releases of PowerPress assuming WordPress core will be abandoning the `get_bloginfo_rss` filter for all other feed fields.
* YOU MUST UPDATE POWERPRESS TO 6.2.2 IF YOU ARE USING WORDPRESS 4.4
* Tested latest changes does not break backwards compatibility with WordPRess 4.3 or older.
* Fixed Clammr typos (Thanks Robin for the heads up!)
* Increased fields with maxlength 250 to 255 for iTunes settings (Thanks Robin for pointing out limit!)


= 6.2.1 =
* Released on 11/22/2015
* Removed logic added in last updated to call the do_shortcode function. We originally added this code to solve a theme conflict, it appears to have cause problems for others so we're reverting back.
 If your theme overrides the audio player shortcode (player will only appear correctly when calling `do_shortcode('[audio]')`), then you must include the following define in your wp-config.php: `POWERPRESS_DO_SHORTCODE`.
* Added new `itunes_subtitle="true"` attribute for `powerpress_subscribe` shortcode, will put your itunes subtitle below your podcast title in the subscribe widget. (Thanks Robert for the feature suggestion!)
* Added new `subtitle="your custom subtitle"` attribute for `powerpress_subscribe` shortcode, you can now customize a subtitle that goes below your title. (Again thanks Robert!)
* Added logic to use cURL library when native HTTP library in WordPress fails. (Thanks Zuke for helping us debug the problem!)
* Added new logic to check for `the_content`/`the_excerpt` used in the http head. Should fix issue for folks using Yoast's SEO plugin with Facebook social enabled.
* Added code for the Clammr audio player to work in the "play in new window".
* Added new "Having Issues?" option, "wp_head check", will not add player and links if within the wp_head function call.
* Updated links for submitting to iTunes and Google Play Music Podcast Portal.


= 6.2 =
* Released on 11/16/2015
* Clammr Audio Player option added to PowerPress.
* Added logic to call the do_shortcode function when themes override the audio shortcode.
* Fixed bug in the media redirect url function when switching between sites for a MultiSite. (Thanks Avi for the patch!)
* HTML output will only append a "\n" when in debug mode. This will prevent situation where some plugins convert new lines into `<br>` tags. (Thanks Avi for bringing to our attention)
* Added new define option `POWERPRESS_DO_SHORTCODE`, when set in your wp-config.php the `do_shortcode` is used rather than calling the `wp_audio_shortcode` function.
* Moved the `wp_enqueue_style` for subscribe widget within the shortcode. Shortcode can now be used outside of `the_content`. (Thanks Robert for letting us know about the bug!)


= 6.1 =
* Released on 10/30/2015
* Added Google Play Music podcast directory support.
* Added Donate Link option under Feed settings tab.
* Removed the enqueuing of mediaelement.js scripts and styles for the player and links in theme pages. PowerPress's player.min.js will only be included on pages with the player or player links. (Thanks wadehammes for bringing to our attention).
* Updated iTunes subtitle and summary values to treat utf8mb4 data as utf8.
* Added better logic for checking for UTF8 values for iTunes attributes.
* Added the text domain setting in the powerpress.php file for [translate.wordpress.org](http://translate.wordpress.org) use.
* Enhanced iTunes summary bug where some iTunes summaries were getting cut to 255 characters fixed.
* Code updated to support PHP7.


= 6.0.5 =
* Released on 9/8/2015
* Changed the Play in New Window logic to support WordPress MultiSite `switch_to_blog()` function calls (Thanks Avi for the patch!)
* Removed the pp_flashembed JavaScript function from the player.js include (we are no longer using flash for fallback).
* Minified version of player.min.js updated.
* Fixed possible XSS vulnerability with the settings tab control.
* Added new `POWERPRESS_CURL` define option for wp-config.php. When set, PowerPress will use it's own cURL logic rather than use the `wp_remote_get()`/`wp_remote_post()` functions.


= 6.0.4 =
* Released on 8/27/2015
* Added new Subscribe by Email option to Subscribe Links feature. By default this new feature is not enabled. Go to "PowerPress Settings" > "Media Appearance" to enable Subscribe by Email.
* Enhanced iTunes Summary feature now maintains <a> links.
* Added check for null values returned from `get_role` function.
* HTTPS URL warnings have been removed. The past year usage of podcast applications that do not support https is now negligible.
* Added support for https:// media URLs for Blubrry and RawVoice statistics services.
* Verify media URL option now verifies SSL certificates and hostnames for https URLs.
* Added Podcast subscribe link support to post type podcasting.

* Added 'mov' file extensions to the list of migrate-able media files.
* Updated migrate media logic to allow for resetting of migration.
* Improved error reporting for blubrry.com API calls.
* Tweaked how Blubrry account linking is presented in plugin to make it easier.


= 6.0.3 =
* Released on 5/7/2015
* Added define option `POWERPRESS_DEFAULT_MEDIA_URL` to enable the default media URL field.
* Fixed notice messages being printed when populating category podcasting settings (thanks slapdashcast for bringing to our attention)
* iTunes image requirements updated, 3000x3000 is now the maximum (previously 2048x2048) for iTunes artwork. 1400x1400 is still the recommended size.
* Added [Subscribe on Android](http://subscribeonandroid.com/), the one-click subscribe protocol for Android. There are currently 6 Android apps that support Subscribe on Android one-click with more to follow in the coming weeks.
* PowerPress Playlist Player SQLi injection vulnerability fixed (Thanks Ben Bidner, Security Wrangler @ Automattic.com!)

* The subscribe shortcode embed attributes are now strictly enforced. If you enter a category or a podcast channel and it does not exist, the shortcode will be empty and will no longer fall-back to the main podcast settings.
* The subscribe shortcode embed specifying a category not displaying category fixed (thanks elembemedia for bringing to our attention)
* Subscribe links below player for category podcasts now works but only if you select 1 category. 2 or more categories complicates things.
* Added logic to fix situation with JetPack and automatic excerpts. Manual excerpts or regular content pages are not affected. (Thanks grahamharper for the details!)
* Added new "Having Issues?" option "Yes, excluding excerpts", will apply player and links fix logic except when the_excerpt filter is called first.
* AudioObject and VideoObject descriptions are now set using the blog post if no itunes subtitle is set.
* Fixed Episode Titles bug, if you did not set a custom episode title the program title was not appended.
* Fixed "Feature Episode" bug, unchecking the option will now properly save.

* Added new define `POWERPRESS_DEBUG` for PowerPress debugging.
* Coming in PowerPress 6.1 we will allow podcasters who use category podcasting to set one of their category podcasts as the "Default". This podcast category will replace the default podcast feed. This will solve a number of complications Category podcasting has in regards to slug name collisions as well as in-page features like the subscribe links.
* Coming in PowerPress 6.1 Podcasting SEO field options will be customizable.

* Released on 1/25/2015
* Duration detection option now works for sites running PHP 5.2 (If you can, please upgrade your PHP, but we understand that some situations warrant running outdated software)

* Even though PowerPress 6.0 requires WordPress 3.6+, code has been added to prevent error messages in the event plugin updated on older version of WordPress.

* Fixed bug with Podcasting SEO settings where Episode Titles could not be disabled.
* Fixed bug where Godaddy customers using PHP 5.4 were getting a blank screen for the PowerPress Settings page due to a bug in the stristr() function. Godaddy is aware of the problem and working on a fix. In the mean time we've replaced calls to stristr() with preg_match().
* Podcast Republic now uses the podcast feed URL for subscriptions (rather than the iTunes URL).
